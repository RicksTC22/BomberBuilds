                    <p class="infoText">Our Company is a subsidiary of Incendiary Investments that is focused on 3D printing, and eventually other future ventures involving laser cutters.  We are the brainchild of Blake - who took on the financial aspects of the company - Angel - who was in charge of the marketing campaign - and Tanner - who was supposed to just look pretty for the camera.</p>

                    <p class="infoText">Our parent company - Incendiary Investments - is the owner of this company, Bomber Bagels, and Explosive Estates.  Bomber Bagels was the first company that it created with the goal to bring bagels to star valley.  After its success, the company decided to expand into new territories of trade, but under the new and more vague name of Incendiary investments.  The first thing that this company did was purchase - with the help of other investors - a piece of property that consisted of two houses and a shop.  It took the two houses and rented them out under a new subsidiary called Explosive Estates and hopes to expand their influence throughout the valley.  As for the shop, in it was born Bomber Builds.  The spacious building was perfect for the several printers that we would need in order to make a market for ourselves.</p>
